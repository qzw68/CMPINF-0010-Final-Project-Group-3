### Abstract
This repository is for Group 3's (Rohaan Wasim & Qizhe Wang) final project for CMPINF0010-Big Ideas In Computing and Information. For this project we had to determine the best neighborhoods in the Greater Pittsburgh Area by choosing 3 metrics to judge and, via the use of Python, Python's Pandas library, and Matplotlib, isolating and interpreting the pertinent information in order to rank each neighborhood, combining the results/scores of all of the metrics, and identifying the highest overall scoring neighborhood which will be deemed the best. We also looked at the overall spread of scores and drew conclusions about the datasets based on some telling outliers. The three metrics we chose were: school enrollment, crime (crime and arrest rates), and poverty rate.
